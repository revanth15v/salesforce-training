# 4. Aura vs LWC

| Aura Components | Lightning Web Components (LWC) |
|---|---|
| Older Salesforce framework | Modern Salesforce framework |
| More complex architecture | Lightweight and faster |
| Uses Aura-specific syntax | Uses modern JavaScript standards |
| Slower performance | Better performance |
| Harder to maintain | Easier to maintain |
| Less reusable | Highly reusable |

---

# Why Salesforce Moved to LWC

Salesforce adopted LWC because modern enterprise systems require:
- Faster UI rendering
- Better scalability
- Improved security
- Reusable components
- Modern web development standards

LWC provides better performance and developer experience compared to Aura.

# 5. Reflection – Why Enterprise Applications Need Modular Architecture

Enterprise applications are large and continuously evolving. Modular architecture divides applications into smaller reusable components.

Benefits include:
- Easier maintenance
- Faster development
- Better scalability
- Improved testing
- Code reusability
- Better collaboration among teams

Modular architecture helps organizations build flexible and maintainable enterprise systems efficiently.
