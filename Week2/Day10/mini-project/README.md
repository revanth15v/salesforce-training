# 9. Reflection

After learning Salesforce and enterprise system design, I realized that modern business applications require:
- Structured data models
- Automation
- Scalable architecture
- Secure backend logic
- Reusable UI components
- Event-driven processing

Enterprise systems combine frontend, backend, database, automation, and integrations to manage large-scale business operations efficiently.

Salesforce demonstrates how cloud platforms simplify enterprise application development while maintaining scalability, security, and performance.
