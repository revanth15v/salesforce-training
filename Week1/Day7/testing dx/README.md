# Testing, Async Apex, and Salesforce DX – College Management System

# 1. Why Testing Matters

Testing is important because it ensures the system works correctly and prevents errors before deployment. In enterprise systems, incorrect data or failed automation can cause major business problems.

### Benefits of Testing
- Improves system reliability
- Prevents bugs and failures
- Ensures correct business logic
- Protects data accuracy
- Improves user experience

### Example
Testing course enrollment ensures students cannot register when seats are full.

# 2. What is Asynchronous Apex?

Asynchronous Apex is a way of running Apex code in the background instead of executing it immediately.

It is used for:
- Large data processing
- Bulk email sending
- API integrations
- Scheduled tasks
- Long-running operations

### Types of Asynchronous Apex
- Future Methods
- Queueable Apex
- Batch Apex
- Scheduled Apex

### Benefits
- Improves system performance
- Prevents slow user operations
- Handles large-scale processing efficiently

# 3. What is Salesforce DX?

Salesforce DX (Developer Experience) is a modern development framework for Salesforce that supports source-driven development and team collaboration.

### Features
- Scratch orgs
- CLI-based development
- Version control integration
- Faster deployments
- Automated workflows

### Benefits
- Improves productivity
- Simplifies team development
- Supports DevOps practices
- Makes deployments easier and safer

# 4. Complete System Workflow

## Step 1 – Student Registration

A student enters registration details such as:
- Name
- Email
- Course
- Department

The information is submitted into the Salesforce system.

---

## Step 2 – Validation Rules Execute

Validation rules check:
- Email is not empty
- Student ID is unique
- Course seats are available

Invalid data is blocked before saving.

---

## Step 3 – Flow Automation Runs

After successful registration:
- Confirmation email is sent
- Registration status is updated
- Fee reminder process may start

---

## Step 4 – Apex Trigger Executes

The trigger automatically:
- Updates enrolled student count
- Reduces available seats
- Prevents overbooking

---

## Step 5 – Formula Fields Recalculate Values

Formula fields automatically calculate:
- Remaining seats
- Attendance percentage
- Student percentage

---

## Step 6 – Platform Events and Notifications

If a course becomes full:
- Faculty receives notification
- Administration receives alerts

---

## Step 7 – Data Storage

All records are stored inside Salesforce objects:
- Student
- Faculty
- Course
- Department

Relationships connect related data.

---

## Step 8 – Reports and Analytics

Reports and dashboards display:
- Student enrollment data
- Course occupancy
- Attendance statistics
- Fee analytics

Management uses these reports for decision-making.

# 5. Important Test Cases

## 1. Invalid Email Validation

### Test
Verify invalid or empty emails are rejected.

### Risk if Not Tested
Incorrect communication and invalid records.

---

## 2. Duplicate Student Registration

### Test
Ensure duplicate student IDs are blocked.

### Risk if Not Tested
Duplicate records and inconsistent data.

---

## 3. Course Overbooking

### Test
Verify enrollment stops when seats are full.

### Risk if Not Tested
Exceeding course capacity.

---

## 4. Trigger Execution

### Test
Check whether triggers update records correctly.

### Risk if Not Tested
Incorrect course counts and failed automation.

---

## 5. Attendance Calculation

### Test
Verify attendance percentages are calculated correctly.

### Risk if Not Tested
Incorrect warnings and inaccurate reports.

# 6. Reflection – Why Enterprise Software Development Needs Structured Workflows

Enterprise software systems are large, complex, and used by many people simultaneously. Structured workflows help teams develop, test, deploy, and maintain applications efficiently.

Structured workflows provide:
- Better collaboration
- Version control
- Reliable deployments
- Proper testing
- Reduced errors
- Easier maintenance

Tools like GitHub, Salesforce DX, and CLI help developers manage enterprise applications professionally and ensure system stability as projects grow.
