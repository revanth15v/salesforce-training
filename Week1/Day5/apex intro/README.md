# College Management System – Salesforce & Apex Concepts

# 1. What is Apex?

Apex is a programming language developed by Salesforce that is used to add custom business logic to Salesforce applications. It works similar to Java and runs on the Salesforce platform.

Apex is mainly used for:
- Custom automation
- Complex calculations
- External system integrations
- Advanced validations
- Trigger-based operations

# 2. Difference Between Flow vs Apex

| Flow | Apex |
|---|---|
| No-code/low-code automation tool | Programming language |
| Easy to build using drag-and-drop | Requires coding knowledge |
| Best for simple automation | Best for complex business logic |
| Faster development | More flexible and powerful |
| Limited for advanced operations | Can handle advanced processing and integrations |

---

# Difference Between Configuration vs Coding

| Configuration | Coding |
|---|---|
| Uses clicks and settings | Uses programming logic |
| Easier to maintain | More customizable |
| Faster for simple tasks | Better for complex requirements |
| Uses Flow, Validation Rules, Formula Fields | Uses Apex and Visualforce/LWC |
| Limited flexibility | High flexibility |

# 3. Real Examples Where Apex Is Needed

## 1. Complex Fee Calculation

### Example
Calculate fees using:
- Scholarship
- Hostel fee
- Attendance percentage
- Late fee penalty

### Why Apex?
The logic contains multiple conditions and calculations that become difficult in Flow.

---

## 2. External Payment Integration

### Example
Connecting Salesforce with payment gateways like Stripe or Razorpay.

### Why Apex?
API callouts and secure data handling require Apex programming.

---

## 3. Advanced Eligibility Verification

### Example
Allow course registration only if:
- Attendance > 75%
- No pending fees
- Required prerequisite course completed

### Why Apex?
Complex conditional logic and multiple object checks are easier in Apex.

# 4. Integrated System Design

## CRM

The College Management System acts as a CRM to manage:
- Student admissions
- Courses
- Faculty information
- Department management
- Communication and automation

---

# Objects

## Student
Stores student details.

## Faculty
Stores faculty details.

## Course
Stores course information.

## Department
Stores department information.

---

# Relationships

```text
1 Department → Many Students
1 Department → Many Faculty
1 Department → Many Courses
1 Faculty → Many Courses
1 Course → Many Students
```

---

# Validation

## Examples
- Email field cannot be empty
- Student age cannot be negative
- Course enrollment cannot exceed seat limit

### Purpose
Validation rules prevent invalid or incomplete data from entering the system.

---

# Flow

## Automation Examples
- Auto email after registration
- Auto update remaining seats
- Fee reminder notifications
- Course full notifications

### Purpose
Flows automate repetitive business tasks without coding.

---

# Apex

## Usage in System
- Complex fee calculations
- API integrations
- Advanced eligibility logic
- Custom business rules

### Purpose
Apex handles complex requirements that cannot be managed using only Flow or configuration.

# 5. Pseudocode Examples

## Example 1 – Seat Availability Check

```text
IF available_seats == 0
THEN block registration
ELSE allow registration
```

---

## Example 2 – Attendance Warning

```text
IF attendance < 75%
THEN send warning notification
```

---

## Example 3 – Fee Reminder

```text
IF fee_due_date is near
THEN send reminder email
```

---

## Example 4 – Scholarship Eligibility

```text
IF annual_income < 150000
THEN apply scholarship
```

---

# 6. Reflection – Why Enterprise Systems Eventually Need Programming

Enterprise systems grow large and complex over time. Simple configuration tools are useful for standard tasks, but advanced business requirements often need custom programming.

Programming is required for:
- Complex business logic
- External integrations
- Advanced security handling
- Large-scale data processing
- Custom automation

Apex provides flexibility and scalability, allowing organizations to build powerful enterprise applications beyond standard configuration limits.
